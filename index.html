        <h2>Players Linked with a Move to United</h2>
        <p>Several players from Ruben’s previous clubs have been rumored to follow him to United. This includes standout talents like Diego Perez, an influential winger, and Sergio Gomez, a skillful playmaker who has been pivotal under Amiron’s coaching.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Interim Success</h2>
    <p>Ruud van Nistelrooy managed to secure a few victories as interim manager, rekindling fans’ hopes. His brief but successful tenure inspired fans to rally around the new coaching team. In Ruud’s words, <span class="quote">"Manchester United deserves only the best, and I trust Ruben to lead us to the top."</span></p>

    <h2>Erik Ten Hag’s Journey with United</h2>
    <p>Former manager Erik ten Hag brought an FA Cup win to United and showcased promise in the Europa League. He was responsible for signings like Antony, who struggled to adapt, and Martinez, a World Cup winner with Argentina who showed promise. Ten Hag also had challenges, including clashes with big names like Cristiano Ronaldo, who eventually moved to the Saudi Pro League, and Jadon Sancho, who found form with Dortmund in the Champions League final before his troubles at United.</p>
